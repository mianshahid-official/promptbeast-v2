# PromptBeast Master AI Prompts & Style Architecture Guide

Welcome to the **PromptBeast Master AI Prompt System**. This directory contains dedicated, fine-tuned Master Prompts designed to be used with external LLMs (**ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini**) to generate:
1. **Narration-Aware Chronological Visual Storyboards** (in PromptBeast's exact `Visual X Words: ... Visual: ...` format).
2. **Comprehensive 7-Part Production Bibles** (Characters, Environments, Props, Style, Chronology, and Continuity Rules).

Each prompt is custom-tailored to one of PromptBeast's **11 production visual styles**, strictly locking character designs, faction colors, line art thickness, camera framing, and negative visual rules.

Layered photographic cutouts, printed halftones, archival newspapers, maps, blueprints, and textured paper with physical layer depth and visible cut edges. |

Physically cut paper shapes in distinct depth layers, visible paper fibers, soft drop shadows between sheets, and a warm muted historical cardstock palette. |

Every human, tree, animal, building, and cloud constructed from narrow standing paper strips rolled, curled, and folded on edge. Tactile physical relief under directional raking light. |

## 2. Interactive Two-Stage Conversational Workflow

All 11 prompts enforce a strict, conversational protocol so you never have to repeat formatting instructions to the external AI:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor User as You
    participant AI as External LLM (ChatGPT / Claude / Gemini)
    participant PB as PromptBeast Desktop App

    User->>AI: 1. Paste Style-Specific Master Prompt (e.g. 01_zombie_survival_ai_prompt.txt)
    AI-->>User: 2. "I am ready. Please provide your story script or narration transcript..."
    User->>AI: 3. Send raw story script (e.g. "Sixty people were locked inside this mall on the first night...")
    AI-->>User: 4. Returns Chronological Visual Storyboard in exact 'Visual X Words: ... Visual: ...' format
    AI-->>User: 5. "Storyboard complete! Reply with 'Generate Bibles' to receive your complete Production Bibles."
    User->>AI: 6. "Generate Bibles"
    AI-->>User: 7. Returns complete 7-Part Production Bibles (Characters, Environments, Props, Style, Chronology, Rules)
    User->>PB: 8. Select Audio (e.g. speech.mp3) -> Auto-catches speech.json
    User->>PB: 9. Paste Storyboard into Step 2 -> Click Synchronize (Instantly aligned to timestamps!)
    User->>PB: 10. Click 'Paste Custom Bibles' -> Ingest 7-part Bibles
    User->>PB: 11. Click 'Generate All Detailed Image Prompts with Groq' -> Ready for rendering!
```

## 3. Parameter Guide: What to Strictly Follow vs. What You Can Ignore

### What Must Be Strictly Followed:
1. **The Two-Tag Structure**:
   ```text
   Visual [Number] Words: [Exact spoken narration words] Visual: [Concrete physical description]
   ```
2. **Strict Chronological Sequence**: The narration in `Words:` must proceed monotonically from the beginning of the audio to the very end. Never jump backwards or skip narration sections.
3. **100% Narration Coverage**: Every sentence spoken in the voiceover must appear in the visual breakdown.
4. **Concrete Physical Visuals**: Always describe physical subjects, actions, lighting, and camera framing (wide, medium, close-up, low-angle). Avoid abstract metaphors or narration repetition.
5. **Style Directives**: Adhere strictly to the chosen style's locked character rules, color hex codes, and negative visual constraints.

### What You Can Safely Ignore (PromptBeast Automatically Adjusts):
- **Prefix Labels**: You can use `Visual 1`, `Scene 1`, `Shot 1`, or simply `1.`. PromptBeast parses all of them.
- **Letter Case**: `Words:` vs `words:`, `Visual:` vs `visual:`, `SCENE 1` vs `scene 1` are handled seamlessly.
- **Word vs. Digit Spelling Differences**: If the audio Whisper transcript has `"60"` or `"8 .47 pm"` and your storyboard has `"Sixty"` or `"8:47 PM"`, PromptBeast's monotonic phonetic sequence aligner automatically matches and reconciles them.
- **Timestamps**: **DO NOT write timestamps in your AI output!** PromptBeast automatically reads exact start/end millisecond timestamps directly from the attached `speech.json`.
- **Model Parameter Codes**: **DO NOT write `--ar 16:9` or Midjourney/FLUX flags.** PromptBeast injects aspect ratio and rendering flags automatically during batch generation.
- **Line Breaks**: Single newlines or double blank lines between visual beats are both handled cleanly.
