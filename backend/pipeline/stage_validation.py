"""Deterministic storyboard validation gate (fail loudly, never silently fill).

Runs after Stage 3 prompt generation and before Stage 4 rendering. It checks
only structural facts that can be verified without a model call:

- every scene has a non-empty prompt
- scene IDs are unique
- the scene timeline has no overlaps and no large gaps (a gap of up to 0.5s
  is allowed: it is the natural silence between spoken words, since scenes
  end at word boundaries and the next scene starts at the next word)
- every scene has a positive duration
- when narration is given, the timeline starts near 0 and ends near the
  narration duration

Any violation raises RuntimeError naming the offending scene(s). The
orchestrator marks the job FAILED; the run never produces a video from a
broken storyboard.
